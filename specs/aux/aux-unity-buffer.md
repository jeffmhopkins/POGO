# aux: Unity-Gain Buffer (Non-Inverting and Inverting)

Design status: [ ] draft → [ ] reviewed → [ ] validated on prototype

## Overview

Voltage follower (G=+1) and inverting unity-gain buffer (G=−1) using TL072CDT or
LM4562 dual op-amps. Used throughout POGO for impedance conversion, signal routing,
and the HP output polarity correction required by the OTA-C SVF summing amplifier.

Two variants documented here:
- **Variant A (non-inverting):** G=+1 voltage follower; input to (+), feedback from output to (−)
- **Variant B (inverting unity):** G=−1; (+) to GND, R_in = R_f (e.g. 10 kΩ each)

IC selection:
- LM4562: input noise 2.7 nV/√Hz — used at module audio input (Block A) where noise matters
- TL072CDT: input noise ~18 nV/√Hz — adequate for all other buffer instances

## Transfer Function

### Variant A (Non-Inverting)

```
V_out = V_in

Bandwidth: f_−3dB ≈ GBW / (1 + G) = GBW / 2
TL072 GBW = 3 MHz → f_−3dB ≈ 1.5 MHz (well above audio)
LM4562 GBW = 55 MHz → f_−3dB ≈ 27 MHz
```

### Variant B (Inverting Unity)

```
V_out = −(R_f / R_in) × V_in = −V_in   (when R_f = R_in)

Closed-loop gain: G_CL = −1
Bandwidth: f_−3dB = GBW / (1 + 1) = GBW / 2   (same as non-inverting)
```

Input impedance of Variant B = R_in = 10 kΩ (lower than Variant A; note the source
must drive R_in without significant loading).

## Design Choices & Rationale

### LM4562 at Input Only

The LM4562 (input noise 2.7 nV/√Hz) is used only at Block A (input buffers) where
the module input noise floor is established. The TL072CDT (18 nV/√Hz) is adequate
for all downstream buffers because audio signals are already at signal-path levels
(±5V) where additional noise is insignificant.

Using LM4562 throughout would increase cost without audible benefit.

### 1 kΩ Series Output Resistor

```
Short-circuit protection: I_max = Vcc / R_out = 12V / 1kΩ = 12 mA
This limits op-amp output stage dissipation during brief shorts (e.g. patching).
1 kΩ with typical load of 10 kΩ causes ≈ 0.1 dB insertion loss — inaudible.
The 1 kΩ is not used on internal nodes (only on jacks and between-board connections).
```

### Clamp Diodes at Module Input (Block A)

The input buffer (LM4562, non-inverting) is preceded by:
- 100 Ω series resistor
- BAT54S Schottky clamp diodes to ±12V rails (actually ±11V after forward drop)

This clamps the LM4562 input to safe levels before any signal processing. The unity
buffer output does not need output clamping; the downstream signal stays within
±11V due to op-amp supply limiting.

### Inverting Buffer for HP Polarity

The OTA-C SVF SUM_AMP (see aux-ota-c-svf) produces an inverted HP output:
  HP_inv = −(x − k·v₁ − v₂)

The Variant B inverting buffer corrects this:
  HP_out = −HP_inv = x − k·v₁ − v₂ = HP (correct polarity)

This matches the DSP: `hp = -(x - k*v1 - v2)` which is the standard SVF HP formula.
The G=−1 buffer costs one op-amp half (already available in the dual TL072 used for
SUM_AMP) with just two 10 kΩ resistors — no additional ICs required.

### IC Pairing

TL072CDT (SOIC-8) contains two op-amp halves. Pairing strategy:
- SUM_AMP (Variant A buffer, one half) + HP inverting buffer (Variant B, other half) → 1× TL072
- LP output buffer (Variant A) can share an IC with a nearby low-gain function
- Block A: LM4562 (SOIC-8) for both L and R input buffers (one IC total)
- Block B: TL072 for both L and R output buffers (one IC total)

## Component Values (POGO-specific)

| Ref (generic) | Part | Package | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| U_BUF_A | LM4562MA/NOPB | SOIC-8 | — | Block A input buffers only (noise critical) |
| U_BUF_B | TL072CDT | SOIC-8 | — | All other buffer instances |
| R_in | Resistor | 0603 | 10 kΩ | Variant B: inverting input; R_in = R_f |
| R_f | Resistor | 0603 | 10 kΩ | Variant B: feedback; R_f = R_in → G = −1 |
| R_out | Resistor | 0603 | 1 kΩ | Series output protection; only at jacks |
| R_in_A (Block A) | Resistor | 0603 | 100 Ω | Input series protection before LM4562 |
| D_in (Block A) | BAT54S | SOT-23 | — | Input clamp; anode/cathode to ±12V rails |
| C_VCC, C_VEE | Ceramic bypass | 0603 | 100 nF | Per IC supply pin; within 1 mm of pin |

### Noise Budget (Block A LM4562)

```
Input noise density: 2.7 nV/√Hz
Audio bandwidth: 20 kHz
Integrated noise: 2.7 nV/√Hz × √(20000) = 2.7 × 141 = 381 nV_rms ≈ 0.4 µV_rms

SNR at ±5V (5V_rms) audio input:
  SNR = 20 × log10(5V / 381nV) ≈ 142 dB

This is well below thermal noise from source impedance (100 Ω source at 300K):
  V_n = √(4kTR × BW) = √(4 × 4.1e-21 × 100 × 20000) = 57 nV_rms
→ Source thermal noise dominates; LM4562 choice is well-matched.

## Known Gotchas / Assembly Notes

- Supply decoupling: 100 nF ceramic on each supply pin, placed within 1 mm of the pin;
  without this, TL072 can oscillate at ~3 MHz with capacitive loads
- Variant B R_in = R_f matching is important for G = −1 accuracy; use 1% resistors
- LM4562 has a higher quiescent current (~10 mA/package) than TL072 (~3 mA/package);
  factor into power budget for Block A
- TL072 input common-mode range does not include the negative rail; at ±12V supply,
  inputs must stay above −11V to avoid phase reversal — this is fine for audio signals
  but note it if unity buffers appear near the rail for bias circuits
- The 100 Ω series resistor and BAT54S at Block A form the CV input protection; this
  same pattern is reused at all CV input jacks (see shared/cv-input-protection.md)
- R_out (1 kΩ) at output jacks: omit on internal signal nodes to avoid unnecessary
  insertion loss and HF roll-off with capacitive loads (e.g., cable capacitance
  30 pF: f_−3dB = 1/(2π × 1kΩ × 30pF) = 5.3 MHz — fine for audio)
